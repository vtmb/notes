## Using Environments in Python3

venv is shorthand for virtual environment

# Creating a environment inside a folder:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

# Using a present environment inside a folder:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

# Leaving a venv

```bash
deactivate
```

To remind you that you are using a venv, the command line has a `(venv)` in its prompt
